# activepipe_robot
This repository is for the coding exercise for ActivePipe.

# Creation Process
There will be 3 model classes:
- The robot class is to create individual robot classes and have checks for the robot if it would hit the border or moves towards the edge.
- The board class is to store the robot classes as well as finding the robot by name.
- The input command class contain functionality for the input file that would place, turn and move the robot as well as reports the robot position.


# Running
There is no need for any setup as long as the input text file exists.
The command to run the file would be the following:
```
ruby main.rb [input text file]
```
